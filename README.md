# kindle-clippings

A fork of Levien van Zon's great kindle-clippings script: https://github.com/lvzon/kindle-clippings

- Exports the highlights and notes to markdown
- Familiar with Czech characters and time/date format

Usage remains the same: `./extract-kindle-clippings.py [<My Clippings.txt file> [<output directory>]]`

Runs smoothly on Windows
